How to run:

*You can use the arrow keys to check the player stuff quicker*

I would run an 'npm install' to install all the require node modules from the package.json but I have zipped them so probably not.
So first you should go on the website in multiple tabs. 
Then you need to type a name into each browser. 
Please don't type the same name for all of them :'(. 
Then you want to either request to be a spectator or player. 
If there are already two players you'll be force to be a spectator. 
If you're a player you can go to be a spectator if you want. 
To move stones you click and drag the stone in the opposite direction like a catapult. 
You are not allowed to click on other peoples stones.
While a stone is moving you cannot move another stone. 
I assume the players are playing fairly and taking their turns
